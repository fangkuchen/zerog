ZEROG
=====
Simple Parabola GNU/Linux-libre post-install script

Dependencies
------------
This script is written for the OpenRC version of Parabola. It assumes that
the nonsystemd repo is already enabled and elogind/libelogind is installed.

Usage
-----
Install Parabola on your system then run:

    curl -O cybvik.xyz/files/zerog
    chmod +x ./zerog
    sudo ./zerog

Customization
-------------
You can change the source for the progs.list, the dotfiles and suckless repo by
editing the corresponding variables at the beginning of the script

AUR
---
The usage of the AUR is highly discouraged by the Parabola developers.
Therefore this script does not install an AUR helper. The git_install function
does make it possible to install AUR packages, but I suggest you keep the
number low and check each PKGBUILD before adding it to the script.

Troubleshooting
---------------
The script will create a logfile (/tmp/zerog.log). In case you run into any
trouble you will find the stderror output of whatever command failed as well as
the names of any programs that could not be installed there.
