ZEROG
=====
Simple Parabola GNU/Linux-libre post-install script

Dependencies
------------
This script is written for the OpenRC version of Parabola. It assumes that
the nonsystemd repo is already enabled and elogind/libelogind is installed.

Usage
-----
Install Parabola on your system then run:

    git clone git://git.cybvik.xyz/zerog
    chmod +x zerog/zerog
    sudo zerog/zerog

Customization
-------------
You can change the source for the progs.list, the dotfiles and suckless repo by
editing the corresponding variables at the beginning of the script

AUR
---
The usage of the AUR is highly discouraged by the Parabola developers.
Therefore this script does not install an AUR helper. The git_install function
does make it possible to install AUR packages, but I suggest you keep the 
number low and check each PKGBUILD before adding it to the script.
