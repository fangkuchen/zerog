ZEROG
=====
Simple Parabola GNU/Linux-libre post-install script

Dependencies
------------
This script is written for the OpenRC version of Parabola. It assumes that
the nonsystemd repo is already enabled and elogind/libelogind is installed.

Usage
-----
Install Parabola on your system then run:

    curl -O https://hanetzok.net/zerog/zerog
    chmod +x ./zerog
    sudo ./zerog

Customization
-------------
You can change the source for the progs.list, the dotfiles and suckless repo by
editing the corresponding variables at the beginning of the script

AUR
---
The usage of the AUR is highly discouraged by the Parabola developers.


Issues
------
Due to a bug in the nonsystemd repo some programs that depend on pipewire/libpipewire
won't install. So far, this affects mpd and mpv from this script. This is a known bug
(see https://labs.parabola.nu/issues/3455) and is not the scripts fault.


Troubleshooting
---------------
The script will create a logfile (/tmp/zerog.log). In case you run into any
trouble you will find the stderror output of whatever command failed as well as
the names of any programs that could not be installed there.
